## Region Feature Generation Script
This repository aims to provide a minimal script to extract region features out of images (or frames) using the latest object detection methods. It also provides a minimal use case of the **PyTables** library for storing the region features on hard disk. That's because the region features, especially when working with video can become very memory intensive sometimes. Note that the object detection code heavily borrows from Detectron 2 framework by Facebook.
